    <h2> About Our Research</h2>
    <p>
        Suicide is a deeply troubling and complex issue that affects individuals, families, communities, and societies at large. It is a global public health concern with far-reaching implications for mental health, social well-being, and public policy. To address this grave challenge effectively, it is essential to employ statistical analysis and data-driven insights to understand its prevalence, patterns, and associated factors. This statistics report aims to identify who among the genders is much more prone to suicide. Since the rate of suicide is increasing rapidly we must find a way to stop this, and so our solution is to find a group of people to prioritize helping first, and that is why we are trying to find out which gender has the highest suicide rate and on what most of them continent do they belong to.<br></br>
        We found this data on “ourworldindata.org”, and it showed the number of people dying through suicide per 100,000 people both men and women in 2019. There was an abundance of countries shown in the data but we only used a sample of 50 countries as it was the amount needed for this activity. For our variables, we have two qualitative variables, continent and the gender with the highest death rate. But in quantitative variables, we have the population, the suicide rate of males (per 100,000 people), and lastly the suicide rate of females (per 100,000 people).<br></br>
        For your information, suicide rates have been increasing rapidly throughout the year, and we need to find a way to stop it. This is a considerable challenge to conquer and so, we must solve it slowly but surely. We must split it into small steps and goals, so it will not be overwhelming. This is why this data is needed to determine which group of people to prioritize.
